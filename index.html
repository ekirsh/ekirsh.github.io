                            <h3>The German Encryption Machine</h3>
							<p>A huge breakthrough for the allies in World War 2 was the cracking of Enigma, the Germanâ€™s encryption machine, which was instrumental to the allied forces claiming victory in World War Two.</p>

									<h2>Battle of the Atlantic</h2>
									<p>One of the major affects that the breaking of Enigma had was the Battle of the North Atlantic. For a long time, German U-Boats had been attacking supplies being brought to Britain during the war. Churchill's advisors were very worried that Britain would starve.</p>
                                    <b>"The only thing that ever really frightened me during the war was the U-boat peril"</b><p> Winston Churchill</p>
                                    <p>After breaking Enigma, the allies had access to thousands of Enigma messages. Although many of them were useless, some contained coordinates and attack plans. The allies could now stay away from incomg U-Boats.</p>

									<h2>Operation Mincemeat</h2>
									<p>On a dead body that they had built a rich backstory for, the allies planted <b>fake</b> top secret documents. They then deliberately left the body on the coast of Spain, hoping it would find its way to Germany. The documents contained plans to invade Greece, while the allies real target was Sicily.</p>
                                    <p>To monitor if the Germans were believing their ruse, the allies used Enigma transmissions to determine whether they could attack Sicily with minimal resistance. Without these Enigma transmissions, the allies could have been unprepared for what they would face at Sicily.</p>

									<h2>The Invasion of Europe</h2>
									<p>The invasion of Europe started with D-Day, which was only made possible by resolving the <a href="#one">U-Boat crisis in the North Atlantic</a>. The ability to read Enigma messages was also just a generally useful ability for the allies to have. While the fighting was happening in Europe, about 7 million peopme were dying everday. Many estimate that the breaking of Enigma shortened the war by 3 years, therefore saving 21 million lives.</p>

							<h2>What is Enigma?</h2>
							<p class="css-typing">The enigma was a enciphering machine invented by a German engineer named Arthur Scherbius. It was eventually purchased by the German army/navy and used for the majority of their World War 2 operations. Although, they made many of their own advancments. </p>
                            <h3>How it works</h3>
							<div class="features">
								<section>
									<span class="icon major fa-bold"></span>
									<h3>Original Letter</h3>
									<p>The sender would type in the letter they wanted to send into the Enigma machine. It will then go through the rest of the processes.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon major fa-plug"></span>
									<h3>Plugboard</h3>
									<p>The signal would pass through something called a plugboard, which allows the user to define a constant set of rules.</p>
                                    <p>Ex. "U" will always convert to "C"</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon major fa-cog"></span>
									<h3>Rotors</h3>
									<p>Three rotors, whose settings are constantly changed, change the letter to a new letter. To make it more complex, the first rotor rotates one step after each press. After 26 presses, the second one begins to change.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon major fa-retweet"></span>
									<h3>Reflector</h3>
									<p>The signal passes through a reflector, which then sends the letter back through through the rotors and the plugboard all over again. This make the resulting encryption even more complex.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon major fa-user-secret"></span>
									<h3>Encrypted Letter</h3>
									<p>After the encryption is done, a new letter lights up on the Enigma that can then be sent using Morse Code to another Enigma user.</p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon major fa-font"></span>
									<h3>Received</h3>
									<p>The soldiers on the receiving end uses the Enigma to reverse this process and decrypt this Enigma code. This whole system relies on both machines being on the same settings.</p>
