                                                <p>All this happened, just because of an assasination that led to an argument between two countries. As more countries began to get involved, this one historical event began to have a huge effect. This war was a major part of the 20th century, which helped define the world we live in today.</p>

											<h4><u>Social</u></h4>
											<p>The social aspects of my "X"</p>
										</header>
                                    <p>In 1914, Austria Hungary was a world power. But there was problem, Nationalism. Many different races lived within the Austria-Hungary empire, so there would be a major problem if nationalism caught on. Out of all of the Austrian empire, "The Balkans" were the most nationalistic, especially Serbia. Most serbians lived Bosnia.</p>
										<p>Bosnia-Herzegovina was the most recent addition to the dual monarchy of Austria-Hungary. When it was annexed in 1908, it helped radicalize Serbian nationlist groups including the 'Black Hand'. They radicalised three recruits from cafes in Belgrade. </p>
                                    <p>In this situation, I think that it was nationalism that really started the conflict. Of course the main causes for WW1 were Nationalism, Imperialism and Militarism, but nationalism was what really started the conflict. Also, I think that the Austrians were imperialists, and they had so many colonies in their control that they lost their power.</p>

											<h4>How did it affect Canada?</h4>
											<p>Why is my topic important in understanding WW1 in Canada?</p>
										</header>
										<p>I think that The Assasination of Franz Ferdinand is a must know to understand Canada's position in WW1. Since Canada is a Britsh colony, it was Britain that Canada joined the war for, not because they were allies with Serbia. If Canada wasn't a British colony, they probably wouldn't have had any involvment in the war.</p>
                                    <p>Canada also began to get some recognition in this war and began to develop their independance as a country. If this hadn't happened, Canada might be a lot more closely associated with Britain than it is currently.</p>
